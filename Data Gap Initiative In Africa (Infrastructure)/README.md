# 🏗️ Data Gap Initiative (Infrastructure)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing **data gaps in infrastructure sectors across Africa**, with emphasis on electricity, housing, transportation, water, sanitation, and waste management.  
The lack of reliable, accessible, and up-to-date infrastructure data hinders **policy-making, investment, and sustainable development**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify, document, and analyze existing data gaps in key infrastructure sectors.
- Assess the accessibility and usability of available datasets.
- Highlight the impact of these gaps on decision-making and growth.
- Recommend strategies to bridge these gaps through open data, improved collection, and partnerships.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Sourced datasets from national statistics offices, government portals, open data platforms, and international organizations.
   - Focused on electricity, housing, transportation, sanitation, and water.

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Evaluated dataset availability, reliability, and completeness.
   - Compared datasets against expected indicators.
   - Visualized gaps in terms of *thematic*, *temporal*, and *spatial* coverage.

3. **Tools Used**  
   - Microsoft Excel & Google Sheets (organization, analysis, visualization).  
   - Python (data cleaning & visualization).  
   - Google Drive / Collaboration tools for teamwork.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Electricity** had relatively better documentation, while **housing** and **transportation** showed significant gaps.  
- **Water & Sanitation** had more datasets but were fragmented and poorly organized.  
- **69% of datasets were structured**, while 31% required additional preprocessing.  
- Thematic and temporal gaps were the most severe and frequent.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
### Short-Term
- Update and clean existing datasets.  
- Promote open access policies.  
- Standardize collection methods.  

### Long-Term
- Develop national open data portals.  
- Train stakeholders and build data literacy.  
- Adopt advanced technologies for real-time data monitoring.

## 🚀 Impact
By bridging these gaps, African governments, investors, and researchers will be empowered to:  
- Allocate resources more efficiently.  
- Improve infrastructure planning.  
- Monitor progress towards development goals.  
- Drive sustainable growth through evidence-based decision-making.
