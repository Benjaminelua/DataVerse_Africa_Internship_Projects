# 📊 Dataverse Africa – Data Analytics Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the **four projects** I completed during my **Dataverse Africa Data Analytics Internship**.  
These projects cover real-world problem domains including fraud detection, trade analytics, healthcare risks, and infrastructure data gaps.  

Each project folder contains:
- 📄 Documentation / reports  
- 📊 Visualizations & dashboards  
- 🧑‍💻 Source code notebooks  
- 🎤 Final presentation slides

## 🚀 Projects Completed

### 1. **Trade and Customs Analytics**
- Goal: Analyze trade data to detect anomalies and inefficiencies in customs.  
- Approach: EDA, trend analysis, anomaly detection, dashboarding.  
- Outcome: Identified trade bottlenecks and recommended improvements in transparency and efficiency.

---

### 2. **Fraud Detection in Mobile Money Transactions**
- Goal: Detect suspicious or fraudulent transactions in mobile money platforms.  
- Approach: Built unsupervised anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF).  
- Deployment: Developed a **Streamlit Dashboard** for visualization and a **FastAPI service** for real-time fraud prediction.  
- Outcome: Ensemble model reduced false positives and flagged ~1.3% of transactions as suspicious.

### 3. **Fake Drugs Detection via Pharmacy Sales**
- Goal: Detect substandard or counterfeit drugs using pharmacy transaction data.  
- Approach: Created risk features (unusual discounts, rare brands, near expiry, suspicious sales channels).  
- Tools: Isolation Forest, LOF, Streamlit dashboard.  
- Outcome: Identified **suspicious pharmacies and suppliers**, flagged near-expiry sales, and highlighted risky sales channels.

### 4. **Data Gap Initiative – Infrastructure**
- Goal: Map and analyze infrastructure data gaps across Africa.  
- Approach: Collected and assessed datasets across electricity, housing, transportation, sanitation, and water.  
- Findings: Severe thematic and temporal gaps, fragmented sanitation data, incomplete housing and transport coverage.  
- Outcome: Recommendations for **open data policies, standardization, and adoption of advanced technologies**.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- Gained practical experience in **EDA, anomaly detection, feature engineering, and model deployment**.  
- Improved skills in **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, FastAPI, and visualization tools**.  
- Learned how to bridge the gap between **technical insights and real-world stakeholder communication**.  
- Developed end-to-end data analytics solutions from **data cleaning → modeling → visualization → reporting**.  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Enhance models with semi-supervised and deep learning approaches.  
- Expand dashboards with real-time monitoring.  
- Collaborate with domain experts for field validation of findings.
